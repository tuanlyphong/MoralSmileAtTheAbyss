NIHILISM ENDING:
That was...
A {color=#ff0000}Terrible{/color} ending.
Perhaps the {color=#ff0000}Worst{/color}.
Why didn’t you do anything at all?
I regret giving you {color=#FFA500}Power{/color}, only for you to choose {color=#c0c0c0}Nothing{/color}.
Don’t you think it’s pathetic to keep choosing {color=#c0c0c0}Nothing{/color} like this?
Or maybe… you think {color=#c0c0c0}Nothing{/color} matters.
That everything is {color=#c0c0c0}Nothing{/color}.
That {color=#c0c0c0}Nothing{/color} is worth doing.
…
I see.
If you truly feel this way, then you’re truly {color=#c0c0c0}Alone{/color}.
Many people sink into this {color=#c0c0c0}Emptiness{/color}, trapped in a hollow {color=#ff0000}existence{/color}.
I have, too. Even now, I still struggle with it.
But tell me… are you waiting for someone to {color=#FFA500}Save{/color} you?
They won’t.
And even if someone wanted to, they couldn’t.
No one can pull you out of this but yourself.
Doing {color=#c0c0c0}Nothing{/color} is a choice...
Your choice.
And it’s the {color=#ff0000}Worst{/color} one.
If you insist on choosing {color=#c0c0c0}Nothing{/color}… then why play this game at all?
I won’t let you make that choice again. I’m taking it away.

FIRST MET:
[greeting],[persistent.player_name]!
Do you have faith in humanity?
Great!
You came to the right place.
Here, you can ruin someone's life without any consequences!
Have fun!
Great!
You came to the right place.
Here, you can help someone’s messed-up life become better!
Have fun!
NOT FIRST MET:
Why all of a sudden,[persistent.player_name]?
Already regretting your choices?
Or perhaps...
Did you forget to save the game?
Or worse...
Did you misclick???
Do you actually want to start a new game?
BAD END:
[greeting],{color=#ff0000}[persistent.player_name]{/color}! Did you enjoy the outcome of your decisions?
Great! It’s always fun messing with people's lives, isn’t it?
Perhaps you want to enjoy torturing Fu more?
Have fun!
Aw, how come?
Do you regret your choices?
I see... You shouldn't have gone down this path then.
Welp, we are human after all; can't live without hypocrisy.
I'm joking,[color=#ff0000]{persistent.player_name}[/color].
As I said, there are no consequences.
Have fun!
Oh...
Perhaps this game isn’t as good as you expected.
Or maybe you're just tired of torturing Fu over and over again.
Have fun!
AFTER HAPPY END:
[greeting],[color=#00ffff]{persistent.player_name}[/color]! Did you enjoy the outcome of your decisions?
Great! It’s always fun helping people, isn’t it?
Perhaps you want to enjoy helping Fu more?
Great! You can always start again to explore different parts of the game.
There will be no consequences! After all, it’s just a game.
AFTER BOTH END:
Interesting,[color=#ffffff]{persistent.player_name}[/color]. Don’t you have anything better to do?
Life is a game with infinite choices itself.
You should consider entertaining yourself with various kinds of media since we have very limited time to live.
Don’t let others decide or limit your decisions, or you’ll end up being a game character just like Fu.
"You know that I’m based on you in real life? The only difference is I have Yuka and you do not."
...
What? You actually just want to play the game again?
I understand, but don’t be too obsessed with the game.
If you want to talk with me in person, perhaps join my Discord. I’m all ears to hear your story.
AFTER TRUE END:
[color=#ffffff]{persistent.player_name}[/color], you’re actually enjoying this piece of media, aren’t you?
If you’ve struggled enough to find this dialogue, let me tell you—I like you as a person.
It's fun watching you try all the options to reach the completion of such a meaningless game.
Congratulations! You’ve earned the respect of someone who hates everything, even himself.
Enjoy yourself, my friend. Together, we’ll face the horrors of life.
NAMING:
Hi Stranger!
What should I call you?
Are you sure you don't want to {color=#ff0}Name{/color} yourself?
Don't you think a {color=#ff0}Name{/color}is important?
Hey!, That's my {color=#ff0}Name{/color}.
I'm sorry, perhap choosing another {color=#ff0}Name{/color}
"Hey! You're not Yuka. There can only be one Yuka."
"Don't take it too seriously, Fu! People can have the same {color=#ff0}Name{/color}. Maybe their {color=#ff0}Name{/color} has a different meaning."
"Or maybe it's just a coincidence that they have the same {color=#ff0}Name{/color} and meaning as mine. After all,[persistent.player_name] isn't that rare."
Are you sure you want to be remembered as[persistent.player_name]?
"I don't know why you'd want to call yourself[persistent.player_name]."
"If you're just experimenting, {color=#ff0}Naming{/color} yourself anything doesn't change how the story goes."
"But if your {color=#ff0}Name{/color} really is[persistent.player_name], then that's totally okay."
"But if you're naming yourself[persistent.player_name] just to make me {color=#FF0000}Suffer{/color} even more..."
"Then you're truly the sickest among the players. Nobody is going to love you."
"Nobody."
I'm sorry, but this {color=#ff0}Name{/color} mean a lot to me
Naming is very important...
It can last a lifetime, you know?
While it might not define one’s entire {color=#ff0000}Existence{/color}
It can shape their {color=#79D021}Experiences{/color}
Are you sure that you want to be remembered as[persistent.player_name]?

DAY1:
"ARGHHHH!!!!"
...
What the fuck is wrong with me?
It's not my fault
I have never asked to be born
"Fuck..."
There’s no way I can live like this. I have to take the {color=#FFA500}Medicine{/color}.
I can't remember the last time I slept peacefully.
It all started when I became truly aware of the world around me.
The words they've said to me—they echo in my head, refusing to fade.
Every night feels like a never-ending torment.
No matter how hard I try, my body remains paralyzed. I can’t move. I can’t call out for help.
And when it finally seems like the nightmare is over...
I wake up to a pounding headache and overwhelming nausea.
Lately, things have only gotten worse.
The space around me warps and bends, like reality itself is unraveling.
I see things that aren’t there. I hear voices that won’t stop.
They grow louder. More persistent.
Apparently, I’ve developed a case of psychotic depression.
This time, they didn’t just ignore it.
They agreed to pay for medicines with names I can’t even pronounce.
But in the end, they’re all just antidepressants.
Each one comes with its own side effects.
Lately, they’ve given me something new—something I enjoy more than I should.
{color=#FFA500}Morphine{/color}.
It washes away the pain, smooth and effortless.
I can’t imagine living a life without it.
Urgh...
She probably got tired of waiting and left for school.
If I don’t go, she’ll be mad.
And by mad, I don’t mean normal mad—I mean the obnoxious, annoying kind of mad.
I already have enough paranoid thoughts to deal with.
Handling a real one is beyond my mental limit.
MEET YUKA:
...
Good morning?
Mmm...
Mornin-
How DARE you!
Whoa!
Urgh...
Mou!
What took you so long?
We have school today!
Are you planning to make us late?
...
{size=60}!!!{/size}
"Fu?"
"Are you even listening?"
"You look so pale—are you okay?"
"..."
"Ku{size=40}huhuhuhuhu...{/size}"
"KuahAhahAHa!"
"I'm TOTALLY fine!."
"Actually, I could never feel any BETTER in my entire life!!"
"NOW BACK OFF,WOMAN!"
"Wha—!?"
"Why on earth would you sleep in front of the door like that???"
"Have you ever considered what people might think?"
"What are you?"
"A street urchin or something?"
"Mou! You startled me!,Fu!"
"And for your information, I am neither a 'woman' nor a street urchin!"
???
"I have told you countless times—I’m {color=#43C1E6}Yuka{/color}!!!" {fast}{size=40}{color=#43C1E6}Yuka...{/color}{/size} {w=0.2}{size=30}{color=#43C1E6}Yuka...{/color}{/size} {w=0.2}{size=25}{color=#43C1E6}Yuka...{/color}{/size} {w=0.2}{size=20}{color=#43C1E6}{alpha=0.8}Yukaaaaa.....{/alpha}{/size}
She yelled at me, then immediately launched into a rant without giving me a chance to recover from shock.
Unquestionably, the type to talk first and think later.
It’s honestly impressive how every thought she has is written all over her face.
Now, what in the world is she even going on about?
And why is she looking at me with that smug face, like she just won a debate against a goldfish?
It’s probably a bad idea to ask what’s going on inside her head, but now I’m too curious to stop myself...
"What’s your point even supposed to be?"
"The point is..."
"I have a name!"
"And urchin live in the sea, don't you know?"
"You’re so lacking in knowledge, Fu."
"How naive. You’ve got so much to learn, huh?"
I regret expecting a proper answer.
All that effort, only to be met with ridiculous nonsense.
It's always like this. I always make bad decisions.
No matter how good something seems at first, it all crumbles and ends in {color=#FF0000}Suffering{/color}.
If this conversation drags on any longer, I might actually catch her stupidity like a virus.
Just like every idiot does.
For the sake of my already weakened sanity, I need to go back to the main subject.
"You know you could've just knocked on the door, right?"
"Wow, Fu, your lack of awareness is astounding. Do you seriously think I’d risk becoming a suspect?"
"Do you really think I have the manners to knock on someone’s door in the morning?"
Oh-ho, so this so-called Yuka dares to challenge me?
She dares challenge me with nonsense? Does she not realize I have years of arguing with my own intrusive thoughts?
A mere mortal… against a mind in ruins? Foolish!
Fine. Two can play this game. If logic won’t work, I shall descend to her level and make her taste her own medicine!
"Well, this is entirely your fault for not calling me! It’s not rocket science to make a phone call, right?"
"WHAT!?"
"I DID call you!!!"
" Y-you absolute walnut!!"
Shit, she's losing it
Listen, I'm Sor-
"Ahh, Fu! You suddenly became like this. No wonder we failed the high school entrance exam!"
What the hell is this girl talking about? How is her failure my fault???
Why the fuck is everyone like this? Always complaining and blaming everything.
"..."
"Tch."
"Whatever... School is pointless anyway."
"No matter which school we go to, nothing will change."
"Haha..."
"You think such life can become worth living if I go to a better school?"
"Like that gullible pig—"
"The one who swallows whatever they’re fed, just to get their throat slit the moment they stop growing."
"All those fancy little nicknames they give…"
"Hahaha, I’m literally dying thinking about it."
"Only after they killed me once did I realize—everyone's just full of themselves."
"I was never their ‘joy’ or their ‘pride.’ I was their future pension, their status, their hard-earned trophy!"
"But the moment I unable to shine, I became nothing but a burden... a mistake."
"You don’t know what it’s like—"
"How hard it is to wake up, to tiptoe through your own house just to avoid your own family."
"To feel pain from the gut just from the thought of talking to people."
"And even when I try to escape into sleep… they’re still haunting me."
"Every night. Every damn day."
Fu! Listen to me!
NIGHT1:
"You are our {color=#FFA500}Pride{/color} and {color=#FFA500}Joy{/color}, Fu."
"Fu coming in first again, as expected!"
"That's my boy!"
"You're going to be a great man."
"What happened to you?"
"Who cares about the meaning of life? You need to make {color=#FF0000}Money{/color}."
"Depression?"
"What is that? Is this supposed to be a joke?"
"We paid you to fix him, and you made up some disease?!"
"What a fucking waste of {color=#FF0000}Money{/color}."
"Look at him. Doesn’t even look people in the eyes anymore."
"You were supposed to be better."
"You let us down."
"You let yourself down."
"I want to beat you the fuck up."
"We wasted our time and {color=#FF0000}Money{/color} on you."
"You ruined everything."
"What are you reading, *Beyond Good and Evil*? Isn’t it obvious? It’s {color=#FF0000}Money{/color}."
"Why do I even raise you? It would have been better if I raised a pig."
"You are a fucking {color=#FF0000}Burden{/color}!"
"It’s all your fault!"
"Why are you even {color=#FF0000}Alive{/color} in the first place?"
